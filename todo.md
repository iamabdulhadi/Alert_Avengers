## Todo List for SQL Query App

### Phase 1: Analyze requirements and plan application structure
- [x] Read and understand the attached requirements.
- [x] Outline the overall architecture and components.

### Phase 2: Set up project structure and dependencies
- [x] Create main project directory `sql_query_app`.
- [x] Create `README.md` with initial setup instructions.
- [x] Create `requirements.txt` for dependency management.
- [x] Create `app.py` for the Streamlit application.
- [x] Create `database.py` for SQLite database setup and sample data.
- [x] Create `agent.py` for the LangChain/LangGraph agent.
- [x] Create `tests/` directory for unit tests.

### Phase 3: Implement core natural language to SQL conversion functionality
- [x] Implement SQLite database setup and sample data generation in `database.py`.
- [x] Develop the LangChain/LangGraph agent in `agent.py` for natural language understanding and SQL query generation.
- [x] Integrate supported SQL operations (SELECT, WHERE, JOIN, GROUP BY, aggregation functions).
- [x] Implement conversational ambiguity resolution and contextual understanding.

### Phase 4: Build Streamlit user interface and integrate features
- [x] Design and implement the Streamlit UI in `app.py`.
- [x] Integrate the agent with the Streamlit UI.
- [x] Display user-friendly output of financial transaction information.

### Phase 5: Test application functionality and create documentation
- [x] Write unit tests for core functionalities (SQL generation, ambiguity resolution, context handling).
- [x] Run tests and ensure at least 60% code coverage.
- [x] Create a design/architectural document (`design_doc.md`).
- [x] Include performance metrics and address challenges in the design document.

### Phase 6: Package and deliver the complete application folder
- [x] Create a setup script for initializing the SQLite database with sample data.
- [x] Ensure all code runs locally without third-party infrastructure.
- [x] Prepare the project for a GitHub repository structure.
- [x] Create a zip archive of the entire project folder.
- [x] Provide a `.txt` file with step-by-step execution commands.
